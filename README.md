# World Status by 2023

## Introduction

The "World Status by 2023" project aims to provide an overview of global statistics and indicators for the year 2023. It involves gathering data sets from various sources, analyzing the information, and presenting it in an accessible manner through visualizations and dashboards.

## Features

- Analysis of various global indicators such as CO2 emissions, population, GDP rank, CPI change, education percentages, birth and mortality rates, armed forces, forested lands, and more.
- Creation of interactive dashboards using Tableau to visualize and explore the data.
- Development of an online application using Streamlit for quick access to visualizations and information.
- Utilization of other libraries and tools such as Plotly, Folium, and Canvas for data analysis and presentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- plotly
- sqlite3
- folium
- scipy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- streamlit
- streamlit_folium
- pydeck

### Tools Used

- Python (Jupiter Notebook)
- Tableau (Data Visualization)
- GitHub (Repositories)
- Canvas (Presentation and Visualizations)
- Streamlit (Web App Development)

### Methodology, Procedures, and Tool Implementation

- **Data Collection**: Data sets were sourced from Kaggle, Github, and The World Bank Data website.

- **Data Preparation**: The data was cleaned, fitted, and transformed using Python's Pandas library. New columns with calculated fields were created to be used in Tableau for further visualizations.

- **Dashboard Creation**: Three functional dashboards were created in Tableau, focusing on areas such as CO2 emissions, population, GDP rank and numbers, CPI change, education percentages, birth and mortality rates, armed forces, forested lands, and forest percentages per country.

- **App Development**: An online application was developed using Streamlit, providing quick access to visualizations and information. This serves as a long-term project for personal development and continual learning.

- **Presentation**: A presentation was created using Tableau and Canvas to summarize the project and showcase the findings.

## Overall Project Objective

The main objective of the project is to gather, analyze, and visualize global statistics and indicators for the year 2023. This involves creating interactive dashboards, developing an online application, and presenting the findings in an informative manner.

### Main Objective

- Develop dashboards using Tableau to visualize various global indicators.
